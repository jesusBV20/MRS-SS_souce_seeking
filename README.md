# Resilient source seeking with robot swarms

This repository was introduced in a lesson given by [Héctor García de Marina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hgdemarina/) at *MRS Summer School 2023*. It contains some Python simulations that help us to validate the results and findings presented in an ongoing work-in-progress article:
