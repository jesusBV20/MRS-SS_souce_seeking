# Resilient source seeking with robot swarms

This repository was introduced in a lesson given by Héctor García de Marina at *MRS Summer School 2023*. It is maintained by [Jesús Bautista Villar](https://sites.google.com/view/jbautista-research), who is currently conducting Python simulations to validate the results and findings presented in an ongoing work-in-progress article:
